Air Painter is a project that allows users to make a quick sketch with the use of hand gestures. With your hands, users can freely manipulate a canvas and develop their drawings. Through computer vision, the system recognizes gestures and the handâ€™s location to create the drawing. The project was inspired by our interest in computer vision and desire to apply it in a visual project
